# Handwritten Digit Recognition - Neural Networks (Multiclass)

This repository contains two versions of a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using Neural Networks:
Version 1: Deep Learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
Version 2: Scratch implementation where every neural network function is manually coded without using high-level libraries.

The project demonstrates solving a multiclass classification problem (digits 0-9) using a custom neural network trained on the famous MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Use of real-world MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- TensorFlow/Keras-based model implementation
- Scratch-based neural network built from the ground up
- Training/Validation loss and accuracy graphs
- Final evaluation and predictions on test data
- Model trained for high accuracy (> 97%)
- Clear code structure with detailed comments

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (core language)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for model building)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
- Scikit-learn (for dataset handling, splitting)
- Matplotlib (for graphs and visualization)

---

## Objective
- Build a Neural Network to classify handwritten digits (0 to 9).
- Understand model architecture, activation functions, cost functions, and evaluation techniques.
- Implement the same logic from scratch to strengthen core concepts of deep learning.
- Compare the performance of library-based and manual approaches.

---

## Example Outputs
- Training vs Validation Loss and Accuracy Graphs
- Predicted Digit Labels alongside the Actual Labels
- High accuracy (> 97%) on unseen test data

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Developed a deep learning model from both high-level and low-level approaches.
- Solidified understanding of:
    - Neural network building blocks
    - Weight initialization, forward pass, backward pass (in scratch version)
    - Model compilation, training, evaluation (in TensorFlow version)
- Enhanced data visualization skills using Matplotlib.
